# Self-Watering-Smart-Pot
Sometimes when we go out of our home for a few days. In this case, we cant give water to our favorite plants or we are busy with other works, so we forget to give water to our plants. Most of the time, we nearly forget about our plants in the mentioned cases. It’s hard to keep our plants alive. Because most of the indoor plants require regular watering. Here I came up with a simple solution. This is just awesome for lazy and busy people like me. My solution is a Self Watering Pot. Any normal pot can be converted into a smart pot. With smart pots, we can make our plants healthy and happy. This Self watering Pot is being made up of NodeMCU

ESP8266. 

# Self Watering Smart Pot Features : 

It will automatically give water when the plant needs water
It will show the water percentage in the soil through the app (from anywhere under the sun where the internet is available)
Also, it will show the temperature and humidity of the plant surroundings
The pot also acts as a container for water. This makes some sort of clean (we don’t need to place any bulky water containers near )
The sensor will detect the water level and shows in percentage.
We can manually give water to plants through the app.
There is no chance of over-watering.
